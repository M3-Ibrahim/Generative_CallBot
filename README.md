# CallBot
This is a chatbot application that uses machine learning and transformer models to provide responses to user queries. It is capable of both retrieval-based and generative-based conversations. The retrieval-based chatbot is used to retrieve pre-defined responses from a database of questions and answers, while the generative-based chatbot uses a transformer-based language model to generate its responses.
